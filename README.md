# Linux-1.0

```
This source code is adapted for compilling on current versions of linux.
Original version of kernel 1.0 was possible compilling only on versions
of linux, that supported a.out format. This was possible only on old versions
of linux (I think that it's true, maybe not :)).
```

## Process for compilling of linux:

1. **git clone https://github.com/Kosmonova/Linux-1.0**
2. **cd Linux-1.0**
2. **make** (repeat it more times, don't worry about error messages)
3. **make start** (it start slackwar harddisk with kernel on floppy disk)

On image file slackwareHdd.img is installed Slackware-1.01.
In this code are some bugs, and aren't all functionality not tested, for
example network connection, graphic interface etc.
